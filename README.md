# California Earthquakes Data Analysis

## Overview
This is the final project for 'Laboratory of Computational Physics mod A' course.
It focuses on analyzing earthquake data specific to California. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and characteristics of earthquakes that have occurred in the region. By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization tools, the project aims to gain insights into seismic activity and its potential implications.

## Features
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize charts, graphs, and maps to visually represent earthquake data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Perform statistical analysis to identify patterns and correlations within the data.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze earthquake occurrence over time to understand temporal trends.
- **Spatial Analysis:** Investigate the geographical distribution of earthquakes and identify high-risk areas.
- **Magnitude Analysis:** Study the distribution of earthquake magnitudes and their impact.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python;
- **Data Analysis Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Astropy;
- **Visualization Libraries:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
